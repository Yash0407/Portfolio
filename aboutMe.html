    <h2>About me!</h2>
    <div class="main-content aboutMePar">
      <p>Hello! My name is Yashvir Singh, and I am a student enrolled in the Computer Science program at York
        University. I completed my high school education in the Non-medical Science stream. One of my unique strengths
        is my ability to take the initiative to learn new skills and tackle any challenge that comes my way. I set high
        standards for myself and enjoy challenging myself with ambitious goal setting.</p>
      <!-- <br> -->

      <p>In my free time, I love to travel and explore new places, cultures, and cuisines. I am also a sports enthusiast
        and enjoy playing and watching games like cricket and wrestling. Besides, I am a music lover and often attend
        concerts to listen to my favorite artists. One of my favorite hobbies is equestrianism, which involves horse
        riding and caring for horses. It allows me to connect with nature and experience the beauty of horses. Overall,
        my diverse interests and hobbies, combined with my strengths and talents, make me a unique and well-rounded
        individual.</p>

      <p>I grew up in Delhi, India, in a joint family, which taught me the value of community and cooperation. I learned
        how to live and work with others and how to be considerate of their needs and opinions. Additionally,
        experiencing the varied seasons taught me to be adaptable and resilient in the face of change. Overall, my
        upbringing in Delhi played a significant role in shaping my values and outlook on life.</p>

    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <div class="main-content vision-par">
      <p id="vis-par">My vision as a software engineer is to develop innovative and sustainable technological solutions
        that tackle real-world problems and improve people's lives. I firmly believe that technology has the potential
        to make a significant positive impact on our society, and software engineering plays a critical role in shaping
        our future.</p>

      <p id="vis-par">My ambition is to harness machine learning, AI, and data analytics to address pressing global
        issues, fostering collaboration among industries to serve the common good. By utilizing my skills in machine
        learning and data science, I aim to enhance lives and promote equitable access to resources. Sharing my passion

      <p id="vis-par">My favorite all-time inspiring teacher is my father, who taught me the importance of perseverance
        and never giving up on my dreams. His willingness to try new things and take on new opportunities has taught me
        the importance of embracing change and being open to new possibilities. His attributes of resilience and being
        comfortable out of his comfort zone have been a source of inspiration for me, and I continue to learn from him
        and strive to emulate his strength and determination in my own life.</p>

      <p id="vis-par">Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam's quote, "Education Is the Most Powerful Weapon Which You Can Use To Change
        The World." has taught me that education is not only a tool for personal growth but also for social change.
        Through education, individuals can challenge inequality, fight injustice, and contribute towards creating a
        better world. Education enables individuals to question the status quo, explore different ideas, and innovate
        solutions to complex problems.</p>
